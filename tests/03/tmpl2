_Description: What interface should be used for configuring packages?
 Packages that use debconf for configuration share a common look and feel.
 You can select the type of user interface they use.
 .
 The dialog frontend is a full-screen, character based interface, while the
 readline frontend uses a more traditional plain text interface, and the gnome
 frontend is a modern X interface. The editor frontend lets you configure
 things using your favorite text editor. The noninteractive frontend never
 asks you any questions.
Default: Dialog
